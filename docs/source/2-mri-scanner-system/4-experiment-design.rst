Experiment design

Email the Brain-Imaging team to have your github username added as a collaborator to the repository.

Every project have a folder under `experiments` named after their project name and under the used modality: `FMRI` or `EEG-FMRI`.
Submit your experiment code by creating a pull request from some branch you created into the `main` branch of this repository.
Add your code to the newly created folder under `experiments/FMRI`, name the directory as your project/task name.

Once your experiment is fully tested and running, it will be merged into `main`.
