Introduction to MRI Spectroscopy
===========================

What is MRI Spectroscopy?
------------------------

Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a non-invasive diagnostic test for measuring biochemical changes in the brain, especially the presence of certain metabolites. Unlike conventional MRI that produces anatomical images, MRS produces a spectrum of resonances that correspond to different chemical compounds.

Key Concepts
-----------

1. **Basic Principles**
   - MRS uses the same basic principles as MRI
   - Detects chemical compounds based on their unique resonant frequencies
   - Provides information about metabolite concentrations

2. **Common Applications**
   - Brain tumor diagnosis and monitoring
   - Neurological disorders assessment
   - Metabolic disorders evaluation
   - Research studies

3. **Key Metabolites**
   - N-acetylaspartate (NAA): neuronal integrity
   - Creatine (Cr): energy metabolism
   - Choline (Cho): cell membrane turnover
   - Lactate: anaerobic metabolism
   - Glutamate/Glutamine: neurotransmitter function
