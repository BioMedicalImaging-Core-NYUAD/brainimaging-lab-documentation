NYU Abu Dhabi’s MRI lab features a 3T Siemens Prisma system.

Specifications:

Field strength	3 Tesla
Bore size	60 cm
System length	213 cm
System weight (in operation)	13 tons
Gradient strength	XR Gradients (139 mT/m8 @ 346 T/m/s8)
Max. amplitude	139 mT/m8
Max. slew rate	346 T/m/s8

Available coils:

- Head/Neck 64 Ultra-fast, high SNR, head and neck imaging
- 32-Channel Head Coil iPAT-compatible coil for fast high-resolution and advanced neuro imaging.
- Tx/Rx CP Head Coil CP Send/Receive head coil with integrated preamplifier.
- Head/Neck 20 for examination of head and neck, for example of brain, neck blood vessels and the C-spine
- Body 18 - Light-weight coil with SlideConnect® technology for easy coil set up and excellent patient comfort. The Body 18 is typically used in combination with the Spine 32 for examinations of the thorax, abdomen, pelvis or hip and is also well suited for cardiac or vascular applications.
- Body 30 - This flexible and comfortable Body 30 coil enables full Field of View coverage and patient comfort. The Body 30 is typically used for examinations of the pelvis, particularly prostate examinations, hip, abdomen, or thorax and is also well suited for cardiac or vascular applications. It is used in combination with Spine coil or with other coils.
- Tx/Rx Knee 15 Flare Coil 15 channel transmit/receive coil for high resolution knee imaging with a flared opening for better patient population fit.
- 4-Channel Flex Coils Multipurpose coils for orthopedic imaging and other applications.
- 4-Channel Special-Purpose Coil The 4-channel special purpose coil is a no-tune receiver coil designed for examination with small Field-of-Views.
- Spine Matrix Coil 24-element design with 24 integrated preamplifiers, 8 clusters of 3 elements each. Smoothly integrated into the patient table and streamlined with Head Matrix coil and Neck Matrix coil

   Figure 2. EEG System

We have an EEG system that complements fMRI by measuring electrical changes in the brain, while fMRI measures hemodynamic changes. Because EEG and fMRI provide distinct spatial and temporal information, combining the two requires special considerations for data quality and participant safety. Our setup includes MR-conditional amplifiers certified by major scanner vendors, with the option to add sensors like accelerometers or GSR for broader physiological monitoring. We have online viewing software allowing for real-time processing to ensure data quality throughout each recording session.

Vpixx System
************
VPixx systems provide MRI researchers with tools that deliver precise, reliable, and highly synchronized visual and often auditory stimuli inside the scanning environment. In particular, the PROPixx projector’s long-throw lens options and robust design allow the device to be placed safely outside the MRI room while projecting clear, stable images into the bore. These systems also integrate trigger inputs/outputs and analog I/O so that the presentation of stimuli can be tightly coordinated with scanner pulses, ensuring that changes in brain activity, captured by MRI, line up exactly with the onset of visual or auditory events.

The system includes:

    - a PROPixx projector
    - an in-bore screen
    - left and right-hand response boxes
    - soundpixx
