Modern Arabic ASR systems such as wav2vec 2.0 excel at word- and sentence-level transcription, yet struggle to classify isolated letters. This paper introduces a diverse, diacritised corpus of isolated Arabic letters and demonstrates that state-of-the-art wav2vec 2.0 models achieve only 35% accuracy. A lightweight neural network on wav2vec embeddings raises performance to 65%. Adversarial training is then applied to restore robustness under noise. Data and code are released on demand to encourage reproducibility and further research.
