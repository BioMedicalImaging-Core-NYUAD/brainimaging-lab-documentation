Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive technique that uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body. Unlike X-rays or CT scans, it does not rely on radiation; instead, the strong magnetic field interacts with the body’s hydrogen atoms, and the scanner detects the signals they emit to create images. This approach allows researchers and medical professionals to see organs, tissues, and other structures with remarkable clarity, making MRI a crucial tool in diagnosing and studying a wide range of conditions.

NYU Abu Dhabi’s MRI lab features a 3T Siemens Prisma system, installed in 2017. This was the first research-dedicated MRI scanner in the Gulf region, signifying an important milestone for scientific progress in the area. Positioned within the NYU Abu Dhabi campus, the facility supports advanced investigations in neuroscience, psychology, and biomedical research. Thanks to its high magnetic field strength, the Prisma scanner provides exceptionally detailed images of the brain and body. This capability enables researchers to delve into the intricacies of brain connectivity, examine cognitive processes, and explore potential strategies for diagnosing and treating neurological disorders. By fostering interdisciplinary collaborations among scientists, engineers, and clinicians, the MRI lab at NYU Abu Dhabi stands at the forefront of cutting-edge research that aims to deepen our understanding of both the human body and mind.
